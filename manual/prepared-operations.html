</header>
<p>PriDE is designed to keep as much persistence logic as possible in
Java code instead of writing stored procedures that reside in the
database. This has several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stored procedures must be written in a highly vendor-specific
language like Oracle’s PL/SQL, so the code is not compatible between
different database systems. On the other hand, Java and PriDE-based
persistence logic is widely compatible, allowing things like unit
testing on a light-weight HSQL while working with an Oracle DB in
production.</li>
<li>As stored procedures are written in a different language that forces
you to violate the DRY principle which is strongly emphasized by PriDE
as one of the most valuable design principles for long-term code
maintainability. E.g the stored procedure’s code can’t refer to
constants defined in Java. They will often break at runtime not at
compile time, and refactoring becomes a fragile job.</li>
<li>You need an additional development environment and appropriate
knowledge which can make things very complicated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although there may still be good reasons to write stored procedures,
you should at least know about PriDE’s capabilities to efficiently run
database mass operations within Java. Some of the mass operation
features have already been mentioned in earlier chapters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Query results are by default provided by ResultIterators, allowing
to iterate through large amounts of results using a single entity. You
can process millions of records without being afraid of memory shortage.
See chapter <a href="find-and-query.html">Find and Query</a> for
details.</li>
<li>Methods spoolToArray() and spoolToList() of class ResultIterator
allow to run multiple co-ordinates selects as an alternative to Joins
when accessing data along 1:N relationships. This allows to minimize the
actual data being transfered from the database to your application.</li>
<li>Updates and deletes may get passed key field lists and
WhereConditions to address multiple records with a single operation. See
chapter <a href="insert-update-and-delete.html">Insert, Update, and
Delete</a> for details.</li>
<li>The class pm.pride.Database provides low-level API functions to
assemble multi-record operations of arbitrary SQL structure. An example
based on method sqlUpdate() can be found in chapter <a
href="insert-update-and-delete.html">Insert, Update, and Delete</a>.
Additional methods are sqlQuery() and sqlExecute().</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepared operations are a thin convenience layer combining JDBC’s
concept of prepared statements with PriDE’s concept of O/R mapping based
on record descriptors. PriDE provides the following prepared operation
types:</p>
<ul>
<li>pm.pride.PreparedInsert</li>
<li>pm.pride.PreparedUpdate</li>
<li>pm.pride.PreparedSelect</li>
</ul>
<p>When you turn on the usage of bind variables (see configuration
parameter pride.bindvars in the <a
href="quick-start-tutorial.html">quick start tutorial</a>) PriDE will
also use these classes internally to run database operations based on
prepared statements. However, using the classes explicitly in your
application code allows to use the same prepared statements for many
operations without reinitializing it with every call. You can also use
them in batch mode which allows to run thousands of operations per
second.</p>
<p>Consider the CUSTOMER table and the appropriate Customer entity class
which is used all over this manual. If you need to insert thousands of
customers in one turn, you should use the PreparedInsert class in a way
like that:</p>
<pre><code>Customer c = new Customer();
PreparedInsert insert = new PreparedInsert(c.getDescriptor());
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; i++) {
    c.setId(i);
    c.setFirstName(&quot;Paddy-&quot; + i);
    c.setName(&quot;Fingal&quot;);
    insert.execute(c);
}
c.commit();</code></pre>
<p>Running this example on an SQLite databases takes less than a second
to insert 100.000 customers. On a local Oracle XE with a usual 4 core
laptop it takes about 30 seconds, i.e. more than 3.000 inserts per
second. But you can even speed up Oracle to SQLite’s performance by
using batched operations instead:</p>
<pre><code>Customer c = new Customer();
PreparedInsert insert = new PreparedInsert(c.getDescriptor());
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; i++) {
    c.setId(i);
    c.setFirstName(&quot;Paddy-&quot; + i);
    c.setName(&quot;Fingal&quot;);
    insert.addBatch(c);
}
insert.executeBatch();
c.commit();</code></pre>
<p>With 100 thousand inserts per seconds, PriDE is a lot faster than all
other O/R mapping tools for Java, even if you consider maximum tuning
options. And you may do a lot of things with this performance before you
have to consider using stored procedures. A key aspect for high
performance is the network latency between the Java application and the
database server. Mass operations are usually performed by batch programs
rather than interactive clients or web sites. You should therefore keep
the network distance between the Java batch programs and the database as
short as possible. Best performance is achieved by co-locating both on
the same server machine using the so-called loopback device and
localhost addresses.</p>
<p>When using prepared operations, you should keep in mind that they
have an open JDBC prepared statement inside. So that you must not forget
to close the operations when the job is done. Prepared operations
implement the AutoCloseable interface, so you may use
try-with-resources:</p>
<pre><code>Customer c = new Customer();
try (PreparedInsert insert = new PreparedInsert(c.getDescriptor())) {
    //... do the job ...    
}
c.commit();</code></pre>
<p>An examples for a mass insertion can by found in the class <a
href="https://github.com/j-pride/manual-example-code/blob/master/src/main/java/mass/MassInsertClient.java">MassInsertClient</a>
in the package <a
href="https://github.com/j-pride/manual-example-code/tree/master/src/main/java/mass">mass</a>
of the PriDE manual source code repository on GitHub.</p>
<p>As you can see from the example, you don’t necessarily need a new
entity for each call of execute() or addBatch(). So as you already know
from the ResultIterator class the whole iteration may operate on a
single entity. Tying both sides together, you can design fast and memory
efficient ETL procedures in Java by reading records from a result
iterator into a single entity, transforming it in place, and directly
passing the result to a prepared operation.</p>
<p>The class PreparedUpdate allows to run mass updates instead of
insertions. By default, the class uses the definitions from the record
descriptor passed in the constructor to tell which fields make up the
key to identify a record and which other fields need to by updated.
However, the class provides a few alternative constructors to define key
fields and update fields separately.</p>
<p>The class PreparedSelect is probably not useful for application code.
It is used internally by PriDE.</p>
