<p>PriDE ist the Java world’s smallest object-relational mapper for SQL databases. O/R mapping is the wide-spread approach to map records of a relation SQL database to objects of an object-oriented application. The application should operate on its persistent entities as object-oriented as possible, not regarding that some of them come from a database or must be saved in one. PriDE provides functionality to</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the mapping of database tables to Java classes</li>
<li>Read and write data records without accessing the complicated JDBC interface, and - as far as possible - don’t write any SQL at all</li>
<li>Simplify the assembly of complicated expressions and selection conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>While O/R mapping is usually based on single-object operations, PriDE also supports efficient database mass processing within Java. The goal is to avoid moving application logic into procedures within the database as far as possible and not to break the DRY principle. However, if stored procedures and functions are required sometimes, PriDE provides a convenient way to call them.</p>
<p>PriDE was designed for usage in JSE and JEE environments and is used identically everywhere except some initialization operations and the transaction management. The framework follows a very pragmatic approach to provide basic development support quickly and easily. It does not claim to conform with established persistence management standards but follows common design patterns and proved to be suitable in mission-critical projects over many years. The <a href="feature-list.html">detailed feature list</a> may help to figure out whether PriDE meets the requirements of individual development projects, and allows to roughly compare this toolkit with existing well-known O/R mapping products and standards like JPA, JOOQ or MyBatis.</p>
<p>PriDE is so small that it can actually be understood in any single line of its code, providing the developer full control over how data is exchanged between an SQL database and a Java application. The runtime library is less than 200 kByte in size without any dependencies beside the JDBC driver library of the database in use.</p>
<p>Did you ever wonder how to conveniently access your SQLite database in a mobile application which has to keep its footprint small? Well, here is your answer :-)</p>
<p>Or did you ever worked in a multi-million lines of code project and got the feeling that JPA magic causes more loss of control than convenience? Guess what the alternative may be.</p>
<p>The chapter <a href="pride-design-principles.html">PriDE design principles</a> gives an overview about the concepts which the framework is based on. However, before diving into more theory, it is recommended to walk through the <a href="quick-start-tutorial.html">quick start tutorial</a> and get into touch with the real world.</p>
