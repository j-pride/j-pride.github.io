<p>You may access multiple databases in an application, using PriDE’s
concept of a <em>database context</em>. As long as you don’t explicitly
address particular contexts, you are implicitly working with a default
context. If you recall the chapter about <a
href="jse-jee-and-resourceaccessor.html">resource accessors</a> and the
the application bootstrap, there appeared two calls which initialized
the default context:</p>
<pre><code>DatabaseFactory.setDatabaseName(...)
DatabaseFactory.setResourceAccessor(...);</code></pre>
<p>If you want to work with multiple databases, you have to initialize
multiple contexts in the bootstrap in the same manner. The contexts are
addressed by name and you perform a context switch by calling the
DatabaseFactory’s static method setContext(). Switching to a context
which doesn’t yet exist, causes the context to be created.</p>
<pre><code>// Initialize the default database context
DatabaseFactory.setDatabaseName(...)
DatabaseFactory.setResourceAccessor(...);

// Create a new context by switching
DatabaseFactory.setContext(&quot;other-db&quot;);

// Initialize the new context
DatabaseFactory.setDatabaseName(...)
DatabaseFactory.setResourceAccessor(...);

// Switch back to the default context
DatabaseFactory.setContext(DatabaseFactory.DEFAULT_CONTEXT);</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively you can add a context without switching back and forth
by calling method addContext().</p>
<p>There are two ways how to work with these contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>By explicit context switching as demonstrated above which will
cause subsequent database operations to operate on the current context.
As context switching is a global configuration change, this is only
suitable for applications without concurrent access by multiple users,
e.g. fat clients or batch applications. You should never use that in a
server application.</p></li>
<li><p>By associating entity types to different contexts. This is
achieved by a call of the context() method when constructing the
appropriate RecordDescriptor</p>
<pre><code>new RecordDescriptor(...)
    .context(&quot;other-db&quot;);</code></pre>
<p>All database operations that are based on that record descriptor will
operate on the associated context. A global context switch is not
required for that, so this concept will also work in server
applications. Usually this is also the more convenient variant. However,
if you make use of this, make sure that your application either doesn’t
call context-dependent static methods of the DatabaseFactory class or
that it is using them safely. Earlier chapters of this manual introduced
the method call DatabaseFactory.getDatabase() to get access to a lower
operation level. This call returns a Database object form the
<em>current context</em> which of course may be the wrong one if you
don’t switch it. In a multi-database server application you should
rather call the alternative getDatabase(String) method which gets passed
a context name.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="multi-database-transactions">Multi-Database Transactions</h2>
<p>Although SQL database usually provide very good transaction safety
for their own, the transaction management across <em>multiple</em>
independent databases is a separate challenge. If your are working in a
JEE environment, the application server should provide a safe
transaction coordination for the involved databases, e.g. a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol">2 phase
commit protocol</a>. In a JSE environment you either have to integration
a transaction manager like <a
href="https://www.atomikos.com/">Atomikos</a> or follow design patterns
that minimize the risk of data inconsistencies.</p>
<p>A recommended design pattern is the so-called <em>best efforts 1
phase commit</em>. If you have to perform modifications in multiple
databases within one transaction then do the actual work in all involved
databases first and at the very end, run the commit calls for all
databases. I.e. inconsistencies can only occur if any of the commit
calls should fail which is a very rare situation. The pattern is
suitable not only for databases but can be applied to any combined usage
of transactional resources. In that case you should start the sequence
of commit calls with the resource with the highest failure risk. E.g.
you may assume that committing a JMS queue or a Kafka topic has a higher
failure risk than committing a transaction on an Oracle database server
based on decades of experience and hardening.</p>
